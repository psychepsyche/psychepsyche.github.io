The [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator][mbti] assessment is a well-known test that is 
said to measure someone's personality. You answer a series of questions and based 
on your results, you get a "type" &mdash; a four letter code like `ESTJ` or `INFP`.

[mbti]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator

The basic idea is that people fall somewhere along a range on four pairs of
preferences ("dichotomies" is the fancy term). By answering a bunch of questions, the
test determines which end best fits your personality.


    Extraversion (E) --- (I) Introversion
         Sensing (S) --- (N) Intuition
        Thinking (T) --- (F) Feeling
         Judging (J) --- (P) Perception

I'm not really into the Myers-Briggs or anything, but some people are! 

I've definitely heard things like "Oh, I won't get along with Joe because he is 
an `INTP` and I'm `ENFP`".

It got me thinking: could you do a similar test tailored to programming 
styles? 

Everyone has their own personality when developing, their own nuances and conventions 
that they follow. And sometimes they aren't compatible across teams. 

If someone favors functionality programming and loves using it everywhere, that could
create friction amongst a group of OO diehards. If I value testing more than you, we 
might argue about a perceived lack of test coverage, neither one of us willing to back
down.

Obviously, I am not a psychologist but I would be interested in taking such a test.

The test questions could feature a bunch of code snippets and you pick which options
you prefer. Maybe the Myers-Briggs for Programming Styles dichotomies would be 
something like:


      Convention/Magic (M) --- (V) Configuration/Verbosity
            Functional (F) --- (O) Object Oriented
           Readability (R) --- (P) Performance
    Quality/Robustness (Q) --- (S) Speed/Productivity

I think some of these traits change depending on context and specific projects, but
I can say that generally speaking I am a `VORS` on this made-up scale. Maybe this
would be useful to know if you were going to work with me or we were always getting
into technical arguments. If nothing else, it would be fun to measure!

What do you think? Has something like this been done before?
