I've been playing the role of UX fairy on my current project at work
this week &mdash; I go around the app, sprinkling little bits of
small improvements.

I thought it might be useful to document some my decisions and reasoning.

Background: The app tracks company projects (who worked on them, what
technologies were used, etc). A new feature was added recently to
allow for project screenshots to be uploaded and displayed, but it 
could use some UI/UX love.

## Scenario: A project with no screenshots

<img alt="Chops UX Step 1" src="{{site.url}}/static/chops-ux-step-1.png">
</a>

Observations: 

* The stock image for [placehold.it][ph] that was left from 
development
* View All link takes user to an empty page that says "No screenshots
for this project"

[ph]: http://placehold.it/

Tweaks:

* Remove hot-linked placeholder with basic styled text; I can't photoshop
my way out of an Adobe-brand paperbag so I have to stick to text instead of
making a better placeholder image
* Add conditional to not render View All if there are no screenshots to
prevent the user from performing an "empty action"

## Scenario: A project with one screenshot
<a href="{{site.url}}/static/chops-ux-step-3.png">
<img alt="Chops UX Step 3" src="{{site.url}}/static/chops-ux-step-3.png">
</a>

Observations:

* Carousel arrows are shown but don't do anything since there is only one
image
* Inconsistent casing on user actions (each word capitalized vs first word
only)
* Use of black `|` pipe instead of gray `Â·` dot does not match rest of the
app

Tweaks:

* Use Javascript to hide carousel controls if there is only one screenshot
* Change user action text to be consistent (we use lowercase
throughout the app) and more terse
* Swap in dot separator

## Scenario: A project with multiple screenshots
<a href="{{site.url}}/static/chops-ux-step-3.png">
<img alt="Chops UX Step 5" src="{{site.url}}/static/chops-ux-step-3a.png">
</a>

Observations:

* Everything looks pretty good!

* I added a screenshot icon to the placeholder using [FontAwesome][fa] for a 
little bit of visual flair

Compared the before and after, had a teammate give it a quick once over,
and pushed the changes to master. While doing this, I noticed that there
isn't a way to remove a screenshot, so I added a work item to implement this
feature.

Overall, I am pretty happy with the changes &mdash; it feels like a good
balance between time and improvement. All in all, it took about 30 minutes 
(less than the time it took to write this post). It's nothing ground-breaking
but making small improvements constantly helps keep the UX tight and gives
other developers good examples to reference.

Hopefully this was helpful! I picked up most of this stuff from working
with others that had a good sense for design and playing around with it
on my own, but there are certainly some common patterns that are generally
applicable.

If you liked this format, let me know on [Twitter][tw] and I'll write up a few
more.
