**What's the point?**  
The authors of *Freakonomics* go meta and explain the thought process they use to analyze and
approach problems in a different way. Thinking "like a freak" means using data and tracing
incentives instead of looking for evidence that supports our own initial hunches.

**How was it?**  
Readers familiar with *Freakonomics* (or other books in this genre) know that these
kind of books feed on anecdotes to help you remember key points. This is no exception.

To remember the concept of "letting a garden weed itself", you might remember the story
of how Zappos offers new employees a cash bonus to quit soon after they start (to allow
people only motivated by money to self-select out). When you come up against an artificial 
barrier, remember how Kobayashi broke the hot-dog eating world records by redefining the problem.

My favorite story was about the idea of [prize-linked savings accounts][plsa]. Instead of
trying to guilt people into saving money, a bank can tap into something deemed "bad" &mdash;
in this case gambling &mdash; and spin it into a positive. A prize-linked savings account
is like a normal savings account, except that a portion of the earned interest is placed
into a shared pool that periodically pays out a lump sum to a randomly selected winner. You
get the fun and excitement of PowerBall, but at the end of the day, you still have your
existing principal amount tucked away safely.

**Who should read it?**  
It's a quick and enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed *Freakonomics* or
that is looking for some inspiration on thinking outside the box.
