After talking with some co-workers, we decided to have a Blog Off. 

#You Should Join Us

Compete for bragging rights, to improve your writing, or to launch your career as a pro-blogger 
(your results may vary). 

If you don't have a blog, you should start one - come find me if you need help and to 
get your blog added to **planet.sep.com**.

##Guidelines:
* Try to write at least once a week, see how long you can keep the streak going
* Need a topic? Come find me and I'll help you out
* Be sure to hassle any of these people if they stop writing!
