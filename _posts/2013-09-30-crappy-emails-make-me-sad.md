Email is a really powerful tool for delighting your users, but I find that
tons of apps are failing to take advantage of it. Sure, you probably don't want
to get cute with your *Password Reset* instructions, but there are so many missed
opportunities to create a great user experience.

Here is an email I got a week ago from Netflix.

Subject: Congratulations to House of Cards!

Uh, what? This email does nothing for me (except make me consider hitting
the unsubscribe button). It is like an internal Netflix company e-card
accidentally got sent to all 29 million subscribers. Yikes.

Netflix, you are better than this!

This was a great opportunity for Netflix to earn some brownie points in my
book. Instead of that self-congratulatory email above, why not something like:

> Congrats to House of Cards on three Emmys. To celebrate, we've made the first episode 
> free to stream this month &mdash; share it with your friends! 

Cool &mdash; now I'll tweet out a link because I freakin' loved that show and I want all my 
friends to watch it. And I get to feel cool for linking people to neat things.

Don't like that version? How about this instead:

> House of Cards won three Emmys, thanks so much for your support. 
> We couldn't have done it without great fans like you watching the
> show and telling your friends, so here is a free month off your bill.

Offer that to anyone that watched all the episodes of *House of Cards* (you've got 
that data Netflix). Boom, instant brand zealots.

Okay, maybe that is too costly. One more idea: since Netflix knows I watched all
of *House of Cards* and that, in the past, I rented all of *The Wire* on DVD and I've
streamed a few seasons of *Mad Men* &mdash; they can probably infer that I like critically
acclaimed TV dramas. Why not craft an email like: 

> Congrats to House of Cards on three Emmys (though you probably already knew that since 
> you have great taste in TV shows)!
>
> Thanks to your support, Netflix will continue it's commitment to producing great
> original content that we know you'll love. 

Why yes, I do have great tastes, don't I?

Netflix &mdash; you have the data, use it! Make me feel special, give me something, help
me become a [bad-ass user][ks]! 

Don't treat the emails you send like throwaway communications. It makes me sad :(
