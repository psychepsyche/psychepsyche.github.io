My last post [detailing the step-by-step process][lp] I use to 
make UX improvements was well-received so here is another 
walk-through for a series of small changes to my current work project.

[lp]: http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/07/18/step-by-step-ux-improvement.html

Background: The app tracks company projects (who worked on them,
what technologies were used, etc). A new feature was added
recently to allow for project screenshots to be uploaded and
displayed, but it could use some UI/UX love.

Today, I am going to be working on the upload page for screenshots.
Screenshots have three components: the actual image, whether it is 
public or private, and an optional caption.

## Starting Point

[![]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-0-thumb.png)]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-0.png) 

It is pretty rough around the edges &mdash; but I will say it is
completely functional and works great! It's just kinda ugly.

Observations:

* `New screenshot` header is unnecessary; the user just
clicked the link to add a new screenshot and this is also shown
in the breadcrumbs
* The checkbox from `Private?` is on a new line (this is very
common in Rails apps because of how the form builder works) 
* The input order is weird; I have to write a caption
and pick the visibility before I pick the image

Tweaks:
* Remove `<h1>` tag, expand breadcrumb to "Add new screenshot"
* Make the `Private?` checkbox inline
* Swap the order of inputs (picking image first)

[![]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-1-thumb.png)]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-1.png)

I particularly like the ordering after this change. The most 
important part of a screenshot is the image and it is right at the
top. The visibility is more important than the caption (which is
optional) so it comes next.

Observations:

* The drag-and-drop landing area is way too big
* Having the file inputs stacked vertically is confusing &mdash; do
I drop and then browse? Why are their two inputs for one field?
* `Drag and drop an image here` isn't great copy and doesn't follow 
other conventions I've seen (text *inside* the landing area)

Tweaks:
* Shrink landing area drastically
* Move drag-and-drop text inside area
* Change file inputs to be side by side with clear indication that 
you can drop **or** browser, not both

Observations:

* The form fits above the fold! Victory!
* `Add this data` is redundant. It is obvious that form fields need
to be filled in.
* Button does not match the styles in the rest of the app 
(smaller, grey background)
* Caption is supposed to be a short description, why is the field
multiline?

Tweaks:
* Remove redundant text
* Apply correct `btn-primary` class to the button, tweak copy
* Change caption to text `<input>` instead of `<textarea>`, tweak copy

## Scenario: Beginner Mindset
Think about the user time a new user lands on this page. 

Something that jumps out to me is the `Private?` checkbox. 
Everyone on the project knows what `Private?` means but a new user
probably won't. This needs some explanatory [microcopy][mc].

The private flag determines whether or not an image is "safe" to
show to the general public. Sometimes we do client work that we
can't talk about (NDA, export controlled, etc) so we don't want
to accidentally use that data in marketing materials.

I also think about the target user. Most of the time, the person
adding screenshots is a project manager or developer. But 
sometimes it could be an intern or a newer developer that 
doesn't know what is or is not "sensitive client information", 
so we should accommodate them as well.

Here's what I came up with:

[![]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-4-thumb.png)]({{site.url}}/static/chops-upload-ux-4.png)

Succinct microcopy that asks the real question we want to know and
an extra `Not sure` option (defaults to making the image 
private).

I also swapped the `Back` link (another silly Rails default) to a 
muted cancel link next to the create button. This is more of a 
personal preference, but I think it feels more natural.

---

And there you have it, a bit more polish to the screenshot upload
page. I think the interesting lessons here are:

* Be deliberate with microcopy to better engage users
* Think of the importance of fields when ordering a list of inputs
* Try using your app with a beginner's mindset

Hope this was helpful, let me know on [Twitter][tw] if you'd like
me to keep doing more writeups in this format.
