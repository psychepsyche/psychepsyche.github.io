> I can't blog/share/talk about that, I'm not an expert!

I hear comments along this line regularly. Sometimes from new developers,
but also, surprisingly, from seasoned veterans.

[Impostor Syndrome][imp] is in full force &mdash; people just don't seem to
think they can add value by sharing what they know about a topic.

Here's a little secret: You don't have to be an expert to provide value,
you just need to be **one day further**.

There is always someone who knows less than you and is in the exact same
position you were a week ago. Write for them.

If you've spent an afternoon figuring out the basics of a framework and you can
distill it down to a 20 minute talk, you have saved someone 4 hours. Speak for
them.

Your 10 years of software experience might not seem remarkable or noteworthy,
but you have countless lessons to teach someone just starting in the industry.
Share for them.

The first time you break through this mental barrier is the hardest. The good
part is that you can acquire the requisite knowledge in just one day.
