A super tactical list for starting a [peer group][pg].

---

## Organizing the group

01. Pick two people (that you already know) that you want in the group -- invite them

    > Hey, I'm organizing a peer group focusing on **topic** -- are you interested in participating in a small group discussion with other local folks?

01. Ask those people to recommend two people they want to be a part of the group -- invite them, too

01. You should have 6-7 people now -- if not, keep asking people that are interested to recommend people to invite

01. Send out three dates for a half-day meeting with [Doodle][d] -- pick the soonest date that everyone can make

01. Email everyone (in one email thread) with the date and meeting agenda -- this is now your discussion forum

01. You will host the first meeting so book the space and handle food

    ## Day of the first meeting

01. You will volunteer to be the moderator of the first meeting

01. Start on time and have everyone introduce themselves -- name, company, role, what they want to get out of the group

01. Set the rules of engagement -- use [Chatham House Rule][ch] unless there is a strong reason not to

01. Explain the discussion format -- use [Lean Coffee][lc] unless there is a strong reason not to

01. Have a productive, educational, energizing, and cathartic discussion with your new peer group

01. Get a volunteer to host next time (quarterly works well)

01. Email everyone thanking them for their participation and enjoy the rest of your day

01. Repeat quarterly, expanding the group with new people as necessary
