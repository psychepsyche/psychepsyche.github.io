[Medium][m] recently implemented a simple feature that I think is 
really great.

[m]: https://medium.com

At the top of every blog post, there is a blurb telling you how long the
article will take to read &mdash; this post is a "3 min read" or a "12 min read".

<div class="pic">
  <a href="https://medium.com/maybe-its-fiction/f7bbc3aa2419">
    <img alt="Medium's Time to Read" src="/static/medium-time-to-read.png">
  </a>
</div>

As soon as I noticed this, I smiled. 

The implementation is probably trivially easy, something like:

```ruby
def minutes_to_read(post)
  (post.word_count / AVG_WORDS_PER_MIN).round
end
```

But what it shows is that Medium has a deep understanding of how people consume
blog posts. 

Do you ever glance at the scroll bar to see if a post is a huge essay or a quick 
hitter you can read while your code is compiling? Because I do all the time. And 
I've never seen this "Time to Read" feature on any other blog platform.

Additionally, it keeps readers on Medium for longer &mdash; even if you are
only mildly interested in an article, if you know it's only going to take 2
minutes to finish, you'll stick it out. Since Medium's whole vision seems to 
be centered around high quality content, preventing a sub-10 second bounce seems 
worthwhile.

Newer models of the Kindle have a similar feature: using your past page turning
speed to predict when you will finish your next chapter (or even the whole book).

<div class="pic">
  <img alt="Kindle's Time Left in Chapter/Book" src="/static/kindle-time-to-read.jpg">
</div>

Kindle users reap similar benefits &mdash; I can decide to pause reading for the 
night or press on a few more minutes to reach a natural stopping point at the 
chapter break. 

And Amazon benefits from me seeing that I have only 20 minutes left in this
book, but eight days of vacation left &mdash; time to go order a new book.

It's a small thing, but **the sum of small UX delights leads to a great product**.

Have you seen any other small bits of awesome UX lately? Hit me up 
on [Twitter][tw], I'd love to hear about it.

By the way, this post should have taken you 2 minutes to read.
