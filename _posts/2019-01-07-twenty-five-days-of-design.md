I spent the month of December completing the [#DailyUI][du] challenges -- a series of design prompts.

## Why?

The idea of building things soup-to-nuts is very appealing to me. 

I like to work on my own projects and I admire folks that are self-sufficient. 

Not having to rely on others means that I have total control.

I think I have good design taste, but I wanted to push myself to "prove it".

## Selected samples

I finished 25 design challenges over the month, all designed in [Figma][fg].

Here are a few designs that I think turned out well:
