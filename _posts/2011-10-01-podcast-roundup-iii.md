Time for another Podcast Roundup - I've only got two new shows this time, but both are
pretty good and worth checking out. Check out the other Roundups: [here](/blog/2011/05/16/podcast-roundup-ii.html) 
and [here](/blog/2010/10/28/podcast-roundup.html) for more recommendations.

#Back to Work
**Hosts:** Merlin Mann, Dan Benjamin  
**Releases:** Weekly    
**Topics:** productivity, work, tools, fuzzy feelings  

[Back to Work][b2w] is a strange show to describe. It's not a programming podcast, it's not a
productivity podcast, it's not a personal development podcast but rather a hybrid of all three.
Dan comes from the world of programming and acts as the devils-advocating, voice of reason to
Merlin's kinda-hippy-yet-makes-sense life and workplace advice.

Topics include how to deal with fear of failure, being honest about your expertise before looking 
for independence, and getting started instead of just thinking about starting. I like that the show
makes me think and looking at myself in an introspective manner - plus the show has it's own quirky
sense of humor and style that make it really enjoyable to listen to.

I've been told by someone I recommended the show to that the first few episodes are hard to get into,
but I think if you can make it to episode 5 (my favorite episode of any podcast ever) you will 
be hooked.

#Coder Talk
**Hosts:** Joey Beninghove, Derick Bailey  
**Releases:** Weekly   
**Topics:** coding, micropreneurship  

[Coder Talk][ct] is a new podcast (seven episodes at the time of this writing) but it reminds me of the
early days of TechZing. The format is a little different than a normal podcast: there are two primary
hosts, but they are joined by panel of other programmers. The topics are a bit jumbled - the cast just
talks about stuff they have been working on recently or new technologies that have been released.

The show is pretty rough in its current state but I think the format is interesting and will improve as 
more episodes are produced.
