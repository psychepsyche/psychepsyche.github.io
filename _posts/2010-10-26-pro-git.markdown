**What's the point?**
This is the defacto book on `git`, the distributed version control system.  It explains how git works 
(storing changes, branching, etc) and also details some distributed workflows that can be used in a team 
setting.  Additionally, there are lots of neat tips and tricks to improve productivity when using git.

**How was it?**
I had some hands-on experience with git already (I have been using it as for my personal repositories for
 about a year) so this book was a nice way to compliment my existing knowledge.  Some of the introductory
 chapters were a bit boring since I knew the basics of using git, but I did not have a really solid 
 understanding of branching so that chapter was really interesting.  The book uses a lot of diagrams and 
 examples to illustrate the advantages of git and this really helped me finally understand why is 'better' than other VCSs.
 The structure of the book is a little disjointed -- it is more of a reference book than a cover-to-cover 
 read.  I particularly thought that the chapter on setting up a git server could have been moved to an 
 appendix and I would have maybe liked more information on team workflows such as feature branching or 
 [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

**Who should read it?**
If you use `git` on a regular basis already, you can probably skip this book.  Some people might like to 
know about the internals, but most people just want something that works.  I think that for someone looking
 to learn git you are probably better off just diving in and using it and then maybe using this book or the
 excellent [GitHub Help pages](http://help.github.com/) when you get stuck.
