**What's the point?**
The book is an exploration of how to best present visual information in a 
variety of mediums.  The book covers six main topics and presents examples 
of each idea.  I chose to read this book because I thought it could be helpful 
in thinking about graphs and visualizations in a new way. 

**How was it?**
I found it to be kind of a letdown.  The book is very highly regarded and 
considered a "classic" so my expectations were high and maybe that was the 
problem.  The book was definitely interesting and the examples are really 
cool, but I don't feel like I was able to take away that much information that 
can be used in software.

The section *Layering and Separation* was most useful, as it demonstrated 
solutions to making grid-based information easier to parse and interpret.  I 
also liked the discussion of negative margins and how `1+1=3 or more`.  Some 
of the other sections (like the map/cartography related ones) were certainly 
interesting, but I didn't really take away anything that useful.

**Who should read it?**
The book is skewed more towards designers, but it is a quick read (lots of 
pictures and under 200 pages).  I would recommend it to a developer with an 
interest in design or information visualization.  Make sure you read it in 
print though, since I don't think the images would work as well in a digital 
format.
