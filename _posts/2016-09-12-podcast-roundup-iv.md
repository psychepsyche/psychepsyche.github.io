Several years ago I wrote about [some][r1] [podcast][r2] [recommendations][r3]. Five years later, I don't listen to most of those anymore. Either they stopped airing or I just moved on.

But podcasts are the greatest so here is an updated list of newish podcasts I think are worth your time.

## Seeking Wisdom
**Hosts:** David Cancel, Dave Gerhardt

**Topics:** product development, career growth

[Seeking Wisdom][sw] is short but sweet. Each episode is between 15-30 minutes, but they pack a big punch. Their is usually a singular topic for each show and David and Dave share their personal take on it.

Why should you care? 

* David did some cool stuff (Drift, HubSpot, Performable) and is just a chill dude
* The intro music is :fire:

## The Intern
**Hosts:** Allison Behringer

**Topics:** serialized podcast about a woman breaking into the startup world

[The Intern][int] -- not to be confused with that [Anne Hathaway/Robert De Niro movie][lol] that was secretly kinda good -- is a well-produced, documentary style podcast about a woman trying to find her way in the New York startup scene. Allison gets hired as an intern at a [tech accelerator][bw] and is tasked with making a podcast about the company. (Aside: I'm a sucker for meta-media like this -- a podcast about someone trying to start a podcast).

Why should you care?

* NPR-level production
* Candid and vulnerable conversations are just good radio
* The ad reads are enjoyable

# Quick-hitters

Since it's been five years since the last roundup I did, here are small overviews of the podcasts I've picked up and stuck with over that time period. Some of these are more popular so you might have heard them already, some of these are completely random and I don't know if I would even recommend.

## Startup
Season 01: Guy quits radio job to start company that makes podcasts (this [meta-podcast][su] is the first product), things start bad but go mostly okay

Season 02: Follows a single company throughout the season, this company has tons of struggles and seems realistic

Season 03: Stand-alone episodes featuring new companies every week

## The Bikeshed + Giant Robots
Two podcasts from [thoughtbot][tb] -- very relevant to my work

[The Bikeshed][bs] is for deeper technical discussions, [Giant Robots][gr] has shifted lately to be more about product development

## The Pitch
It's basically Shark Tank for tech companies in [podcast form][p], good filler + exposure to new ideas

## Kalzumeus podcast
[Patrick McKenzie's][p11] [podcast][kp] -- worth putting up with terrible audio and irregular schedule because I always learn a ton of stuff

## The Random Show
[Tim Ferriss + Kevin Rose][rs]. I like most of Tim Ferriss' stuff and listen to his [interview podcast][tf] on and off (more off lately), but I really like this version of the show with Kevin Rose. It also feels a little more fun and grounded when Kevin is there. Good for finding out about new gadgets, books, and other nick-nacks.

## Stop Podcasting Yourself
Has nothing to do with tech, software, or self-improvement -- just a stupid, fun [comedy podcast][spy] with two Canadian hosts and a random guest.

## TechZing
The only holdover from the 2010 podcast list. I feel very personally invested in this show, but I can't really think of any reason to listen if you haven't already sunk [300+ hours][tz] into it like I have.

## Serial
It's good. Buy the hype. [Season 02][ser] was underrated.

PS. I use [Pocket Casts][pc] for Android + this [Bluetooth dongle][bt] in my car for podcast enjoyment.
