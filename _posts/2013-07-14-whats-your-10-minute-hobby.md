I often find myself with 10 mintues on my hands. I might be waiting for a 
meeting to start, in line at a take-out place, or riding as a passenger in a
car.

I've been trying to find a way to capture this time and turn it into something
productive. My current time filler is to check Twitter or Hacker News &mdash;
something I do more than enough of already.

Ideally, I'd like something that I can do on my phone that has some value and
is conducive to being done in small chunks.

I haven't found what a great solution yet but here is what I have tried:

* Puzzle game: I like the simplicity and design of this puzzle game but it
got repetitive and depends on randomness too much; plus games are not very 
productive
* Sudoku: More mentally stimulating, but didn't hold my attention for long; games
seemed to take too long and it was hard to remember where I left off
* Go "Tsumego": This is like the puzzle mode of the ancient board game Go; there
are apparently tons of these online with a good range of difficulties but I could
not find any good Android apps that were beginner friendly
* Learn a language: Many people suggest studying a foreign language with 
vocabulary flash cards and some type of spaced repition model; I don't speak any
languages and I think this would be hard for me to stick with
* General SRS: Use a spaced repition app to help memorize some stuff; I tried
Anki but I couldn't find any decks that seemed useful to me

Maybe I am being too picky, but I'd like to find something mental stimulating to 
fill this dead time with.

What should I try next? Any suggestions?
