It was Wednesday night. 10:45 pm.

The project was due at the start of the lab. Just under six hours to go.

The ECE270 semester project was not worth a large portion of your grade, but
it did carry consequences if you bombed.

I was working in a group of four, though I felt like a group of one. Not because
I was pulling the weight of the rest of the group, but because **I** was the one
being pulled.

I was doing fine in the class, but I got talked into an ambitious project design
&mdash; one that I wasn't capable of executing. I tried my best to make 
contributions, but as the deadline loomed, I felt helpless. 

Unable to help debug the problems we were having, I just sat behind a wizard, 
hoping that he could conjure the right magic for us to pass the course.

It was a horrible feeling of not being in control. I was leaving my fate up to
someone else. I didn't like it.

The same feelings came rushing back to me on a recent project. As the project 
schedule slipped, I was frozen. I couldn't fix the problems &mdash; I didn't
know how. All I could do was try to give general advice and serve as a rubber
duck.

I could see my teammates struggling and putting in long hours, but I couldn't
help.

I get very uneasy when I have to work with something I don't understand. 

Treat it like black box! That doesn't really work when your self-confidence has
been shredded as you flail around not getting anywhere.

I felt this on a small scale when I started doing web development. There were big
areas where I just felt helpless: JavaScript, databases, testing, CSS.

It led me to expanding my breadth and picking up front and backend skills. I think
I even have pretty good design chops now. 

I did not want to end up helpless again. I hated having to rely on other people to
finish my projects. I had high standards of quality &mdash; sometimes irrationally
high &mdash; and I wanted to just do it myself to make sure it was done right.

It's not really working. 

Sure, I can ship an app on my own. But the fringes are always scary and never stop
expanding.

Provisioning servers is still largely a mystery to me. I can string together some
jQuery but client-side MVC is kicking my ass. I have trouble maintaining quality
across larger apps. Customer interviews and the people aspects of building a 
product make me anxious.

I can't do it all. 

I need to get better at letting go and trusting others. But man, that is hard.
