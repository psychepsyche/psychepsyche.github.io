[overall tone seems critical of remote, but I don't feel that way; I don't think it's bad, just harder]

For the past year I've been in a somewhat unique arrangement: I'm working on a colocated, medium-sized development team. But our team also works remotely with both individuals and other teams as part of a larger product team.

As such, I've gotten to experience a slice of the remote work style, with one foot still in the traditional, onsite way of working. After living it for 12 months, I have a new apprecition for organizations and teams that are able to work effectively in a remote-only environment.

A crucial part was that our whole team did in-person onboarding at the start of the project. While spending a few weeks living out of a hotel wasn't my favorite, the time spent working in-person with our future collaborators was invaluable. It would be nearly impossible to get up to speed as quickly as we did if we were only relying on voice or chat based communication. We continue to maintain these relationships with periodic travel and by hosting our colleagues in our own office.

Nearly all of the issues we've had can be traced back to empathy and communication. While we have good personal relationships with folks that we get face-time with, as we collaborate with an expanding circle of teams, we often lack shared background and trust. [needs work]

It can be easy to treat people poorly when we view them as simply an email address and not a person. In a remote environment, the importance of written communication is amplified. Tone and emotion are very difficult to convey over text to a person you've never met or even just talked to.

While the ecosystem of tools to facilitate remote work (screen sharing, voice chat, fancy chat clients, etc) is blossoming, these tools have not permeated the enterprise IT world. It can be challenging and frustrating to do remote pair programming when the screen sharing software lags badly or when only one party can control the keyboard. These are problems that have solutions, but sometimes reality (okay, mostly bureocracy) hamstrings our ability to work effectively.

I've taken for granted that colocated teams can have a quick, "everyone turn around and talk about this for a minute" dicussion or that I can read a person's emotions as we have a discussion. These are tough problems that require deliberate action in a remote environment.

I've found myself writing better commit messages and more helpful code review comments out of necessity and not idealism. The need for simple language in technical discussion has been reinforced. I've had to provide context to make work stand on it's own -- without the shared context that a tightknit team might have.

Overall, the experience wasn't swayed me much toward either style. I'm glad that I was able to get experience working more asynchronously and the lessons I've learned will be applicable in any environment. I feel better equipped to work remotely. [this is so weak and wishy-washy]
