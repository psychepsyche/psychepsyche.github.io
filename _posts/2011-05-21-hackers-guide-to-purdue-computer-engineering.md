#Introduction
A common opinion that I hear throughout the software community is
that 'I was never taught these things at school!' or 'I wish my 
degree would have covered more practical and modern material!'. 

It is easy to see how this could happen. Most universities\* aim to teach
students the fundamentals of computer science and that often involves
starting from scratch.  Students enter with a wide variety of skills
and prior knowledge -- some haven't programmed at all, some have taken
AP Computer Science in high school and some have been hacking for years
already. Given this broad spectrum, it is understandable that students
hungry for learning are often left unsatisified with the depth and breadth
of their degree programs.

That being said, you are ultimately responsible for what you get out of
your four (or maybe more) years as an undergrad. Yes, it's going to be
more work and you will have to go outside of your comfort-zone. But in
the end, taking control of your education will allow you to enter the
real world with a running start.

> Okay, sounds good and all...but who are you? Why should I listen to you?

Well, I'm Matt. I graduated from Purdue in 2010 with a BS in Computer
Engineering. I work as a software engineer and love what I do. Between
my sophmore and junior year I realized that I wanted to write software
for a living; I had just gotten past all the introductory
engineering courses and didn't really want to change majors to Computer 
Science. Plus, my roommate was a CS major so I knew that it wasn't really
much different.

This was the point that I realized I needed to be more pro-active if I wanted
to make the most out of my remaining semesters and land a job that I would
enjoy.

I remember reading [Jeff Turkstra's](http://turkeyland.net/education.php)
course summaries and really enjoyed them. I liked reading about Jeff's path
of study and it was cool to read about the actual courses I would be taking.
Now, a year out of school, I want to give back and share my own advice and 
experiences.

for non-'power house' CS programs

#Courses
Note that the course numbers may not match up anymore - especially for 
non-ECE classes.

##Test Out Credits
Credits you earn from AP exams or test-out exams are helpful, but I found
that most of them don't apply towards an engineering degree so they aren't
as useful as your high school counselor made them out to be.

The only AP credit I was able to use was for Calculus. I took the 'A/B Calc'
exam and earned credit for MA165 (Calc I). This allowed me to finish the
calculus requirements during my freshmen year.

I would also recommend trying to test out of some foreign language classes;
they were probably required in high school and you would be surprised how
much you retain.  I tested out of Spanish 101/102 without much trouble.

Lastly, you should test out of COM114 - Fundamentals of Speech.  No excuses,
just do it. Assuming the policy hasn't changed, this class is required for
ALL engineering degrees at Purdue. To test out, I had to take a multiple
choice test and give one short speech. Take a week in the summer and knock
this out - unless you want to attend the 3 hours of lectures a week and 
give 3-5 speeches during your already busy semester...

##Freshmen Year - First Year Engineering Program
All engineering disciplines share a common first year cirriculum, for better
or worse.

Fall 2006 - Semester 1 - 15 Credits
CHM 123 - General Chemistry for Engineers I - 4 credits
I started off pretty poorly in chemistry, I didn't really understand the
material in high school and the course moved pretty fast. The only 'hack'
that I have to share is try to find a lab partner that wants to go into
Chemical Engineering and cling to them.

ENGL 108 - Freshman English - 3 credits
Nothing really special about this course; it's essentially another year
of high school english. We spent the whole semester on *1984*, which
I already had read for school once. Go to lecture, knock out a few papers
and move on.

MA 173 - Calculus II - 4 credits
ENGR 126 - Engineering Problem Solving - 3 credits
ENGR 100H - Freshmen Engineering Lectures - 1 credit


##Gen-Eds
Some people think you should talk gen-ed electives that are interesting
to you and broaden your knowledge. I think you should just take the
classes that require the absolute least effort to get an A; you don't want
to let your GPA drop or spend any extra time in these classes.

Here are my picks:
ECON 251 - Microeconomics
It's the same material as AP Econ, 90% of the course is common sense

PSY 120 - Elementary Psychology
Huge lecture with Powerpoint slides, no homework, mainly memorizing 
some vocabulary words

PSY 200 - Intro Cognitive Psychology
See PSY 120, more of the same

POL 130 - Intro to International Relations
Remember that big section on game theory from ECON 251? Ya, it's about 1/3
of this class too.

Other tips:
- If the class doesn't fit your schedule, pick something else. You are not
going to want to trek to campus at 7:30am for any of these classes.
- Try to make all the lectures, if you do this you can spend a couple hours
reviewing before each exam and do well
- Look for other engineers in your classes or find a friend in another major
that wants to take the class too
- Go for 3-a-week lectures instead of Power Hours, lab classes are usually
on the same Tuesday/Thursday schedule; plus it easier to fall behind if you
miss a few Power Hours

##Clubs/Organizations
Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) - You can be invited to join when you are a junior or senior
in ECE. HKN hosts Industry Presentations, Friday social events (TGs) and runs
the ECE Student Lounge in the basement of the EE Building.

The Lounge is a great place to hang out between classes or get a snack. As an HKN
member, you have to work an hour shift making coffee and working the concession 
stand.  It is actually a good time to become friendly with ECE professors and TAs
since they frequently stop in for coffee.

HKN is a good chance to get leadership experience; there are many officer positions
and they have elections every semester. If you want to get involved, you will be able
to without much difficulty.
