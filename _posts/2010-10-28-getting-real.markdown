**What's the point?**
The book is primarily about how to run a lean start-up.  By having less features, less organizational bloat, and bootstrapping yourself, 
they argue that you will have a more successful business.  The main takeaway I got was to just start actually working on something; 
build half a product, not a half-ass product.  Don't worry about how you will scale for 10,000 users when you don't even have 10 users.

**How was it?**
There are tons of practical examples in this book and it is full of great advice for running your own small business.  I am familiar with
 working in a lean environment, but there were some new ideas about how to make your customers happy that I think could be valuable.
 The book is a quick read, most of the chapters are broken down into 1-2 page essays which makes it easy to come back later and pick 
 up a new piece of advice that you may have missed the first time.  I really liked the closing thoughts in the book:

> Everyone can read a book. Everyone can come up with an idea. Everyone has a cousin that's a web designer. Everyone can write a blog. Everyone can hire someone to hack together some code.
> 
> The difference between you and everyone else will be how well you execute. Success is all about great execution.

**Who should read it?**
There is a little something for everyone in this book.  Feature selection and coding practices for developers, organizational tips 
and staffing for managers, and promotions and sales techniques for marketing and business development.
