What I did
- consulting company
- I built this tool, turned into internal, turned into product
- stars aligned for 4 months of dedicated time
- implement paid plans and try to sell it

What happened to MoraleApp
- large drop-off when turning on paid plans
- long-term sales/marketing team?
- never had a compelling pitch on how to use it

Struggles / Challenges
- 90% fail, how many at bats?

What went well
- happy with artifacts produced
- didn't get bogged down writing code
- good breadth of new experiences
- got to try out a new role

When went badly
- unstructured time
- analysis paralysis
- solo work
- hard to know "right answer"
